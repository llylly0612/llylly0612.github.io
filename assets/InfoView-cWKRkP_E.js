## Giant pandas "Xingxing" and "Liangliang": our years in Malaysia!
On the morning of August 29, 2023, a ceremony to welcome giant pandas "Yiyi" and "Shengyi" back to their home country will be held at the Giant Panda Pavilion of the National Zoo of Malaysia. The two pandas will be flown back to Chengdu, China in the evening of the same day.
The naming ceremony was attended by Malaysian Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Taki Ting and Chinese Ambassador to Malaysia Ouyang Yujing. Tarkidin said the name "Sheng Yi" represents peace and friendship, and the Malaysian government hopes to further strengthen relations with China and enhance the friendship between the two countries. 
Zhang Jiexin, director of the Chinese Cultural Center in Kuala Lumpur, said in his speech at the birthday party that the cooperation on giant pandas in Malaysia is for the study of giant panda reproduction and survival, but also to popularize knowledge of giant pandas, so that the local people can learn about giant pandas up close and personal, and at the same time, use the giant panda as a messenger to enhance the friendship between the people of China and Malaysia.
Malaysia's National Zoo Vice Chairman Rossley said that the pandas in Malaysia are friendly messengers and symbols of the friendship between Malaysia and China.
