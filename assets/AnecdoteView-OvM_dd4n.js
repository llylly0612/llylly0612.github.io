# Panda's Panda Diet
## 1. Panda Diet
`),r=s(`
Giant pandas are very intelligent animals, as demonstrated by their excellent foraging strategies. They not only select the bamboo species with the best nutritional value in the region, but also prioritize the parts with the highest nutritional value. The preferred order of feeding is bamboo shoots, young bamboo, and bamboo poles. According to the different parts of the bamboo that giant pandas feed on in different seasons, their daily intake is roughly as follows: bamboo shoots about 23~40kg; or bamboo leaves about 10~14kg; or bamboo culms about 17kg.
## 2. Giant panda friends
`),d=s(`
The panda's close neighbors mainly include golden monkeys, twisted-horned antelopes, red pandas, and hairy-crowned deer. These precious animals basically live in the same environment as the panda. Through long-term coexistence, they live together in the same area in a coordinated manner, but each of them occupies its own space, with a division of labor in nutrition, day and night activities and seasonal coordination, and through food as a link, they form a more stable animal group.
