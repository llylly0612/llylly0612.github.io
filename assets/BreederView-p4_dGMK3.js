## 1. Baby daddy carefully selects bamboo
Malaysia has a favorable climate, geography and superior species for bamboo cultivation, with 70 species in Malaysia, 50 in West Malaysia, 30 in Sabah and 20 in Sarawak.
The panda family is now consuming 5 types of Malaysian bamboo, and the breeding team goes to the bamboo forests in Negeri Sembilan and Perak three days a week to select them.

## 2. The Cat Showoff' by Dr. Matt Naeem
Dr. Matt Naeem, head of the Giant Panda Conservation Center, explained that in order to protect the teeth of giant pandas, keepers have to give them different kinds of bamboo alternately. For the harder bamboos, they will also be specially split into thinner strips for chewing.
Fresh bamboo is used as the staple food, and then apples, pears and bamboo shoots are cleaned, weighed and cut into pieces to make a fruit plate, plus panda "cake" snacks that are carefully baked using eggs, soybeans, corn, rice, sugar, salt, calcium powder and corn oil - each and every one of these meals! Each "panda meal" is made according to a recipe on the wall, with the name, start time and type of food clearly labeled, and the weight calculated to the nearest gram.
